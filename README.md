# RCA1802_Tester
Using an Aruino Mega 2560 to test RCA/Harris/Intersil 1802 processors

I boughtt a batch of old RCA 1802 micro-processors from C.H. Ina & Company on eBay. When they showed up it was obvious that had been sanded and re-labeled. The rest of the parts for the project I wanted them for had not arrived and I wanted to test them before complaining.

I had an Arduino Mega 2560 sitting on the bench and thought I would try to use it to test the 1802s. This project is the result of that effort...

NOTE:
 PCB Design, button handling code, and EF randomization code from: Hans Liss, Thanks Hans!
