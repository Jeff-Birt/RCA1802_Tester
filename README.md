# RCA1802_Tester
Using an Aruino Mega to test RCA/Harris/Intersil 1802 processors

I bot a batch of old RCA 1802 micro-processors from C.H. Ina & Company on eBay. When they showed up it was obvious that had been sanded and re-labeled. The rest of the parts for the project I wanted them for had not arrived and I wanted to test them before complaining.

My other parts for the 1802 project had not yet arrived but I had an Arduino Mega 2560 sitting on the bench and thought I woudl try to use it to test the 1802s. This project is the result of that effort...
